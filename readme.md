                        memory2.cpp working explained


This is a C++ program that simulates a simple memory management system. It defines a class MemoryManager that manages a fixed amount of memory and keeps track of the allocated and free memory blocks. The program creates an instance of this class and performs a series of memory allocation and deallocation operations, followed by running a simulation for a specified number of time units.

Here is a breakdown of the main components of the code:

The MemoryManager class: This class is defined with private data members and public member functions. The private data members are used to keep track of the current state of the memory management system, such as the total memory size, the amount of allocated memory, the number of processes, etc. The public member functions include allocateMemory, deallocateMemory, and runSimulation.

The main function: This is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the MemoryManager class with a memory size of 100 units. It then performs a series of memory allocation and deallocation operations by calling the allocateMemory and deallocateMemory functions with different process IDs and sizes. Finally, it calls the runSimulation function to simulate the system for 5 time units and print out the current state of the system at each time unit.

The allocateMemory function attempts to allocate a memory block of the specified size for the given process ID. It first checks if there is enough free memory available. If there is, it searches the free list for a suitable block of contiguous memory that can accommodate the process. If it finds one, it marks the memory block as allocated and updates the relevant counters. Otherwise, it increments the numWastedBlocks counter and returns false.

The deallocateMemory function deallocates the memory blocks that were allocated to the specified process ID. It removes the entries from the processMap and adds the corresponding memory blocks to the free list. It also updates the relevant counters.

The runSimulation function simulates the memory management system for a specified number of time units. At each time unit, it prints out the current state of the system, including the number of processes, the number of wasted blocks, the number of fragments, and the amount of allocated memory.

Overall, this code implements a simple memory management system with a fixed amount of memory and a first-fit allocation strategy. It can be modified and extended to implement more complex memory management strategies and policies.
